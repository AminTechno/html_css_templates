HTML and CSS templates
======================

Extremely simple templates for starting a small project.

##box-sizing

Web pages by beginners often look horribly different in different Web browsers. Often this can be traced back to the ways in which margin and padding are specified in the CSS. Some Web browsers interpret some aspects of margin and padding differently from other browsers.

Resource: [The CSS Box Model](http://css-tricks.com/the-css-box-model/) This is a pretty good illustrated explanation of the box model, which is at the root of the box-sizing issue.

##reset stylesheet

The Web design community includes various opinions about use of a reset stylesheet for CSS.

##universal selector

The Web design community also expresses various opinions about use of the universal selector (*) in CSS. I used the universal selector in the stylesheet css/boxsizing.css in this collection.

##floats

In CSS, float declarations are commonly used to place elements (such as images, or sidebars) on a page. They pose challenges for beginners, in part because usually they must be "cleared" after use.
